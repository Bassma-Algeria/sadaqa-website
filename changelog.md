# FRONTEND

## Branch: homepage-frontend

### Added

-   Support for positioning the icon at the start or end in `baseInput`.
-   Option to make the label in `baseInput` optional.
-   Added search input component to the inputs.

### Changed

-   Updated the baseInput to handle the position of the icon at the start or at the end of the field (we need it in the case of the search input).
-   Made the label in `baseInput` optional (the search input doesn't have the label).
